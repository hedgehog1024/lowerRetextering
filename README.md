# lowerRetextering
A project to make a lower resolution version of Minecraft mods' textures which have high resolution textures by default.

Use issue system to suggest other mods for retexturing and pull requsts in case you have good textures to suggest.

If you are looking for an actual texturepack, you can find it in folder named after mod in file called "lowerRetexturing_%modname%.zip". Just drop it to resourcepack folder to make it work.

# TODO list
* make a better texture for vacuum item from Simply hammers
* start retexturing Draconic Evolution
* stop procrastinating and actually develop the project
